### 1. Introduction

A **Mapping Campaign** refers to an organized effort of collecting data from a particular geographic area/feature and creating maps. This may involve using various mapping technologies such as; GPS, satellite imagery, or crowdsourced data. These technologies are used to gather information about the area of interest.

Mapping campaigns can be carried out for lots of different purposes, some examples are:

- Disaster Response and Recovery
- Environmental Conservation
- Urban planning or;
- Social and Political Activism.

They often involve collaboration between organizations like: Government Agencies, Non-profit Groups and volunteers.

Once the data is collected, it is analyzed and processed to create detailed maps that can have a variety of use cases. These could be:

- Identifying areas of need.
- Planning infrastructure and development projects.
- Understanding the impact of environmental changes on the landscape, etc.

### 2. An Overview Of The Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) In Relations With Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), Open Street Mapping (OSM) and Open Data Kit (ODK).

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT**) is a non-profit organization that uses open mapping data to support humanitarian and disaster response efforts around the world. **The Field Mapping Task Manager (FMTM)** is one of the tools that **HOT** used to coordinate and manage mapping projects.

**FMTM** is a software tool that helps project managers to organize and manage mapping tasks. It assigns those tasks to volunteers and tracks their progress. The tool includes features for collaborative editing, data validation, and error detection. This ensures that the data collected by volunteers is accurate and reliable.

**FMTM** is designed to be used in conjunction with **Open Data Kit (ODK)**. **ODK** is a free and open-source set of tools that allows users to create, collect, and manage data with mobile devices. The **ODK** provides a set of open-source tools that allow users to build forms, collect data in the field, and aggregate data on a central server. It is commonly used for data collection in research, monitoring and evaluation, and other development projects.  

Project managers use **FMTM** to manage tasks and assign them to volunteers. The data collected by the volunteer via ODK is typically uploaded to **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. **OSM** is a free and open-source map of the world that is created and maintained by volunteers.

1. Navigate to the [HOT website](https://www.hotosm.org/).

2. Click on the Tools & Data feature on the **HOT** Dashboard.

3. Select Task Manager from **“Tools we use”**.

4. Click on the **Sign up button** in the upper right corner of the Tasking Manager homepage.

5. Provide your name and email address (We will use this information to guide you through the sign-up process).

6. A new tab will open allowing you to register on **OpenStreetMap.org**. Provide your account information and press the Sign up button at the bottom of the form.

7. Close the tab and go back to the Tasking Manager. Click the button to Log in.

8. Select Explore projects in the main navigation to find a project to help map. Or use the link provided by your mapathon instructor.

9. Read the introductions to the project and click on **Contribute** to begin with a mapping task.

10. Map a randomly selected task for mapping by clicking on the button **Map a task**.
Alternatively, you can select one from the map or the task, and choose **“Map selected task”**.

11. This opens the editor; map all the features asked for in the instructions.

12. When finished mapping, save your edits and select the button **Submit task**.
After this, you can go back to step 7 and select a new task for mapping.

5. To begin mapping, click on a task closest to you that has the color code associated with **READY** and change it's status from **READY** to **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**. Remember to take note of the number tag.

6. Scroll to the bottom of the page. The **ACTIVITIES** tab shows the tasks either **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**, **BAD** or **LOCKED FOR VALIDATION**. You can search for tasks with the status mentioned using the number tag associated with each task.

7. The **MY TASKS** tab shows the tasks available for mapping and the QR code associated with each task. Scroll through and select the number tag of the task you locked earlier for mapping to bring out the corresponding QR code.

8. Open your ODK collect app, tap on the icon on the top right hand corner of the app and select 'Add project'. Proceed to scan the code generated earlier on the FMTM website.

> Note: If you just downloaded the app, click on the **Configure with QR code** option.

Now you can start field mapping!!
